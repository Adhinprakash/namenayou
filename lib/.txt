runtime variable 

In Dart, a variable with the dynamic type can hold values of any type,

 and its type can be changed during runtime


In Dart, the num type is a generic type that represents both integers and floating-point numbers
  
  
  
  List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];
List<int> moreNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5, 6];


int x = 10;
int y = 20;

int max = x > y ? x : y;

print

The late keyword in Dart is used to indicate that a variable will be initialized at a later point in time,


void printName(String firstName, [String lastName = 'Doe']) {
  print('$firstName $lastName');
}

void main() {
  printName('John'); // Output: John Doe
}
